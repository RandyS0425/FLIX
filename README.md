### Notes
First of all I just want to say that this app was very fun to make! I really enjoyed the process of learning new concepts, and getting to try them out. First, one of the things I struggled a lot was with downloading cocoapods, I kept getting errors until I decided to uninstall it and download it with homebrew and it worked! My second struggle was identifying 'MovieCell' it turns out I was not identifying it in the right place, luckily a TA answered my question which saved me tons of time!
