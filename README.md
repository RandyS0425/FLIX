### Notes
Overall, this app was one of the most helpful projects I have done. This project further solified my knowledge on, tableviews, connections, imageViews, collectionViews, etc. During the development of this assignment I encountered a variety of roadblocks, but one of the most significant ones was when my collection view was not displaying the movies properly. I had done everything the instructions had told me to do, but for some reason the layout was not correct. I later found that the issue was that the width was not being set properly. Thankfully, One of the instructors and I pinned pointed the issue and solved it. I'm very thanful that I encountered this issue, because I now know to look out for teh in the future.
